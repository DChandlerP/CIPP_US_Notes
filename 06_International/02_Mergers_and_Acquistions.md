# Privacy in Mergers, Acquisitions, and Divestitures

Corporate transactions introduce significant privacy risks that must be managed throughout the deal lifecycle.

### 1. Pre-Deal Due Diligence
*   **Process:** Similar to third-party vendor vetting but more intensive. The acquiring company must identify the target's privacy risks before assuming liability.
*   **Key Reviews:**
    *   **Data Processing Obligations:** Assessing the target’s compliance with privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA) and its own privacy policies.
    *   **Contracts:** Reviewing cloud contracts and data processing agreements (DPAs) to ensure transferable rights and adequate security measures.

### 2. The Transaction & Controller Change
*   **Asset Transfer:** In many M&A deals, customer lists and databases are key assets being purchased.
*   **Controller Liability:** The transfer of personal data to a new owner (the acquirer) constitutes a **change of controller**. The new controller instantly assumes responsibility for complying with all applicable laws and existing third-party agreements.

### 3. Transition & Integration
*   **Unifying Systems:** Merging legacy databases with new systems creates vulnerability.
*   **Documentation:** Critical to maintain strict accountability and logs during the migration of data to ensure no records are lost or exposed.
*   **Culture Clash:** Integrating teams with different risk appetites and privacy cultures can lead to compliance gaps if not managed via training and policy alignment.

### 4. Post-Integration Assessment
*   **Updated Assessments:** The combined entity is effectively a "new" organization. It requires a fresh **Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)** to evaluate the new data flows and technologies.
*   **Policy Harmonization:** Privacy notices and internal policies must be updated to reflect the practices of the unified entity.

### 5. Divestitures (Selling Off Units)
*   **Data Separation:** Requires "untangling" shared infrastructure (e.g., HR systems, CRM).
*   **Risks:**
    *   **Data Left Behind:** Failing to completely scrub sensitive data from sold assets (servers/laptops) creates ongoing liability for the seller.
    *   **Ongoing Compliance:** If the seller retains a copy of the data (e.g., for transition services), they remain a controller/processor with continued legal obligations.
