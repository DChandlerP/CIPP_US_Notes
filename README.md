## 1. Branches of U.S. Government

The U.S. federal government operates on a system of checks and balances with three coequal branches.

### Legislative Branch (Congress)
* **Role:** Creates new laws and revises existing ones.
* **Source of Power:** **Article I** of the U.S. Constitution (*Article I powers*).
* **Check on Executive:** Holds the **power of the purse** (controls spending) and the power of **impeachment** (requires a majority vote in the House and two-thirds conviction in the Senate).
* **Composition:**
    * **House of Representatives:** 435 voting members, based on population, elected to two-year terms.
    * **Senate:** 100 voting members (two per state), elected to six-year terms.

### Executive Branch (President, Departments, Agencies)
* **Role:** Carries out and enforces the laws created by the legislative branch.
* **Source of Power:** **Article II** of the U.S. Constitution (*Article II powers*).
* **Check on Legislative:** **Veto power** over bills passed by Congress (Congress can override with a two-thirds majority in both houses). The power to enforce (or decline to enforce) laws.

### Judicial Branch (Federal Court System)
* **Role:** Interprets the meaning of laws, resolves disputes, and determines constitutionality.
* **Source of Power:** **Article III** of the U.S. Constitution.
* **Check on Legislative & Executive:** **Judicial review**—the power to strike down laws or practices that conflict with the U.S. Constitution.
* **Court Structure (Lesser to Greater Superiority):**
    * **U.S. District Courts:** The trial courts of the federal system.
    * **U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeal:** Intermediate courts that accept cases on appeal from District Courts; decisions are binding only within their geographic circuit.
    * **U.S. Supreme Court:** Highest court; decisions are final and binding on all inferior courts. Determines which cases to accept through *certiorari*.

## 2. Sources of Law

Laws in the United States come from a variety of sources:

* **Constitutional Law:** The highest possible source of law; no other law may conflict with it. The **Supremacy Clause** (Article VI) establishes that the Constitution is the supreme law of the land.
    * The word *privacy* does not appear in the Constitution, but constitutional protections are established by the **Fourth Amendment** (protects against unreasonable searches and seizures) and Supreme Court precedent.
* **Legislation (Statutes):** Laws passed by Congress (federal) or state legislatures.
    * Federal laws are compiled in the **U.S. Code**.
* **Administrative Law:** Rules and regulations created by executive branch agencies to implement statutes.
    * Commonly documented in the **Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)**.
    * *Example:* The HIPAA Privacy Rule and Security Rule were created by HHS to implement the HIPAA statute.
* **Case Law:** Interpretations of law made by courts over time to resolve disputes.
    * **Stare Decisis:** (Latin for "let the decision stand") The principle that previous decisions on questions of law serve as **precedent** guiding future decisions.
* **Common Law:** A set of judicial precedents, originating from the English court system, that guides decisions even if not codified in legislation (e.g., torts like negligence).
* **Contract Law:** Legally binding agreements between parties to exchange things of value.
    * Requires: capacity, an offer, acceptance, **consideration** (exchange of value), and mutual intent to be bound.

## 3. Core Legal Concepts

### Jurisdiction
A court's authority to render legal judgments has two elements:

* **Personal Jurisdiction:** A court's authority over the **person** (individual or corporation) being sued. Established through:
    * Physical presence.
    * Place of residence or business.
    * **Consent** (e.g., a clause in a contract).
    * **Minimum contacts** (conducting business within a state).
* **Subject Matter Jurisdiction:** A court's authority to hear cases on a **particular area of the law** (e.g., federal courts over federal law).

### Legal Definitions
* **Person:** A legal entity that can sue, be sued, own property, and sign contracts. Includes **human beings** (citizens, residents) and **legal organizations** (corporations).
* **Preemption:** Law from a **higher authority** (e.g., federal) takes precedence over law from a lower authority (e.g., state). Established by the **Supremacy Clause**.
* **Private Right of Action (PRA):** The ability for **individuals and corporations** to bring cases to court for violations of a specific law.
    * **Contains PRA:** CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act).
    * **Lacks PRA:** FERPA, GLBA, HIPAA.

### Legal Liability
Liability is being responsible or answerable in law.

| Type | Description | Standard of Proof |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Criminal Liability** | Violating a criminal law (requires *mens rea* or "guilty mind"). | **Beyond a reasonable doubt** |
| **Civil Liability** | Failing to carry out a legal duty (e.g., breach of contract, torts). | **Preponderance of the evidence** (greater than 50% chance) |

### Torts and Negligence
* **Tort:** A civil wrong that involves harm to one party caused by the action or inaction of another, *not* involving a contract.
* **Negligence (A Tort):** Harm caused by a failure to act with reasonable care. Requires four elements:
    1.  **Duty of care:** An established responsibility.
    2.  **Breach of duty:** Violation of that responsibility.
    3.  **Damages:** The accuser suffered some form of harm (financial, physical, emotional).
    4.  **Causation:** The breach must be the result of the damages.
* **Four Invasion of Privacy Torts (Common Law):**
    1.  **Invasion of solitude:** Physical or electronic intrusion (e.g., accessing someone's email).
    2.  **Public disclosure of private facts:** Disclosure of truthful, non-newsworthy information that would offend a reasonable person.
    3.  **False light:** Disclosing information that causes a person to be **falsely perceived** by others.
    4.  **Appropriation:** Unauthorized use of someone’s name or likeness.

    # Regulatory Enforcement in U.S. Privacy

## Federal Regulatory Authorities

The **executive branch** enforces privacy laws through various agencies, often relying on the authority granted by different statutes.

### Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
* **Key Authority:** The FTC Act grants authority over **Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices (UDTPs)**, which is the primary basis for regulating privacy and cybersecurity.
* **Structure:** An independent agency led by five commissioners, with no more than three from the same political party.
* **Additional Laws:** Also enforces laws like the **Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)**.
* **Enforcement Process:**
    * Initiates **investigations** based on consumer complaints or other stimuli.
    * May issue a formal **complaint**.
    * Contested cases go before an **Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)**, with appeals possible to the FTC Commissioners and then the federal court system.
    * Most cases settle via an informal resolution or a formal, enforceable **consent decree**.

### Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices (UDTP)
A practice may be unfair, deceptive, or both.

| Standard | Criteria | Core Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unfair Practices** | 1. Injury must be **substantial** (financial harm or unwarranted health/safety risk). | Requires a finding that the injury is not outweighed by benefits and is not reasonably avoidable. |
| | 2. Injury must not be **outweighed by countervailing benefits** to consumers/competition. | Often applies when a company **fails to implement security controls** to enforce its own privacy policy (e.g., *Wyndham Worldwide*, *LabMD*). |
| | 3. Injury must not be **reasonably avoidable** by consumers. | |
| **Deceptive Practices** | 1. Practice must be **likely to mislead** the consumer (representation or omission). | Must be material—likely to affect the consumer’s conduct or decision regarding the product or service. |
| | 2. Examined from the perspective of a **consumer acting reasonably**. | Enforcement focuses on misrepresentations about data use, security, and message retention (e.g., *Facebook*, *Zoom*, *Snapchat*). |
| | 3. The representation, omission, or practice must be **material**. | |


# FTC Privacy Enforcement Case Examples (UDTP)

## Unfair Practices (Security Failures)
The FTC uses the **Unfair** standard when a company fails to implement reasonable security measures, leading to substantial consumer injury.

* **Wyndham Worldwide:** The hotel chain suffered multiple data breaches due to a failure to implement reasonable security (e.g., strong passwords, firewalls). The action was upheld, finding it **unfair** to promise security but fail to provide adequate safeguards.
* **LabMD:** The company exposed a file with patient information on a peer-to-peer network. The FTC found the lack of sufficient cybersecurity practices to be **unfair**.
* **DesignerWare:** A rent-to-own company secretly installed spyware on rented computers that captured keystrokes and images. This intrusive monitoring was deemed **unfair**.
* **LifeLock (Security):** The identity theft protection service failed to implement strong security controls for its own customer data, violating its advertising claims and a prior consent decree, resulting in a **$100 million fine**.

## Deceptive Practices (Misrepresentations)
The FTC uses the **Deceptive** standard when a company makes misleading statements or omissions about how it handles, protects, or uses personal data.

* **Facebook:** Charged with making deceptive claims about users' ability to control privacy, specifically allowing app developers access to user information even when users restricted access. This led to a large fine for violating a previous consent decree.
* **Zoom:** Misled consumers into believing its service used **end-to-end encryption** (only users see content), when it used less secure encryption that allowed Zoom to access the content.
* **Snapchat:** Informed users that messages and photos disappeared forever, while knowing that users could easily **preserve** them. This was a **material deception** about the service's core functionality.
* **GeoCities:** **Resold personal information** of customers after telling them in its privacy policy that it would **not** do so. This direct contradiction of its policy was deemed **deceptive**.
* **TRUSTe:** The privacy certification firm was found **deceptive** for failing to conduct required **annual recertifications** of its clients' privacy practices, violating the promise implied by its **Trust Mark** seal.

### Other Federal Agencies
* **Federal Communications Commission (FCC):** Regulates interstate and international communications, enforcing rules related to **Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI)** under the **Telecommunications Act of 1996**.
* **Department of Health and Human Services (HHS):** The lead agency for implementing and enforcing the **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)** Privacy and Security Rules, issuing substantial fines.
* **Department of Commerce (DOC):** Manages the U.S. portion of the **Privacy Shield** and its successor, the **Data Privacy Framework (DPF)**, which govern transatlantic data transfers.
* **Banking Regulators:**
    * **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)** is the lead agency for consumer financial protection.
    * Other involved agencies include the Federal Reserve, FDIC, NCUA, and OCC.
* **Department of Education (ED):** Enforces the **Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)**, which regulates the handling of student educational records.

## State Regulatory Authorities

State governments also have significant enforcement power.

* **Attorneys General (AG):** Most enforcement actions are brought by one or more state attorneys general under state privacy laws or **Unfair and Deceptive Acts and Practices (UDAP)** laws, which are similar to the FTC Act but vary by state.
* **California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA):** The first state-level agency specifically dedicated to privacy and data protection, established by the **California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)** to enforce its provisions.

## Self-Regulatory Programs

These programs allow industries to develop and enforce their own privacy and/or security standards, often to preempt government regulation.

* **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS):** A highly successful self-regulatory program focusing on security and data retention for the credit card processing industry. Merchants must comply via contractual agreements with banks.
    * It contains 12 high-level security requirements (e.g., firewalls, encryption, strong passwords).
* **Network Advertising Initiative (NAI):** A self-regulatory framework for digital advertising, publishing a code of conduct covering notice, opt-out, and data security. The NAI conducts compliance reviews and can refer noncompliant companies to the FTC.
* **Trust Marks:** Symbols (e.g., the **TRUSTe** seal) displayed on a company’s website to show that an independent third party has certified the company meets specific privacy standards.
* **Safe Harbors:** Agreements like the **Privacy Shield** (and its successor, the DPF) that offer firms exemption from prosecution under certain laws if they demonstrate compliance with specified regulatory requirements, particularly for international data transfers.
* 
# Information Management

## 1. Data Governance

**Data governance** programs identify, track, and manage sensitive information to ensure consistent data handling practices across an organization.

### Building a Data Inventory
Developing an inventory is the first step in managing sensitive data. Organizations should catalog the types and locations of sensitive information they maintain:

* **Personally Identifiable Information (PII):** Broadly refers to any information that uniquely identifies an individual.
* **Protected Health Information (PHI):** Medical records subject to **HIPAA**.
* **Financial Information:** Personal financial records maintained by the organization.
* **Government Information:** Data subject to specific rules and classification requirements.

### Data Classification
**Data classification** organizes data into categories based on sensitivity and the potential impact of unauthorized disclosure. This guides the selection of security controls.

* **Government Terminology:** Uses categories like *Top Secret*, *Secret*, *Confidential*, and *Unclassified*.
* **Business Terminology:** Often uses terms like *Highly Sensitive*, *Sensitive*, *Internal*, and *Public*.
* **NIST Guidance:** The **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)** publishes guides like **SP 800-53** to specify controls for low, moderate, and high-impact information.

### Data Flow Mapping
**Data flow mapping** tracks how personal information is **received, handled, shared, and disposed of** throughout the organization.

* This process produces **data flow diagrams** that vary in detail (technical vs. business process).
* Diagrams help identify potential privacy and regulatory concerns, especially with **third-party data sharing**.

### Data Lifecycle Management
Data protection must be maintained from collection to disposal.

* **Data Minimization:** Collecting the **smallest possible amount** of information necessary to meet business requirements.
* **Purpose Limitation:** Information should only be used for the **purpose for which it was originally collected** and consented to.
* **Data and Records Retention:** Data should be kept only for as long as necessary.
* **Secure Disposal:** Data must be securely destroyed so a determined adversary cannot reconstruct it.
    * **Paper Records:** Shredding (cross-cut), incineration, or pulping.
    * **Electronic Media:** Electronic erasure, degaussing (magnetic fields), or physical destruction.
* **FACTA Disposal Rule:** Requires covered organizations to take **“reasonable measures to protect against unauthorized access or use of the information in connection with its disposal”** of consumer reports (e.g., shredding, using certified destruction vendors).

## 2. Workforce Training

Workforce training ensures users understand their obligations and the risks involved with handling personal information.

* **Regular Training:** Should take place on an ongoing basis, often using **computer-based training (CBT)**.
* **Role-Based Training:** Training should be customized to an individual's job responsibilities (e.g., system administrators need highly technical training; customer service needs more focus on social engineering).
* **Content:** Must include regulatory requirements and practical steps for protecting data.

## 3. Cybersecurity Threats

Threat actors are differentiated by their sophistication, resources, motivation, and whether they are **internal** or **external**.

| Threat Actor | Description | Skill/Resources | Motivation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Script Kiddies** | Users of pre-built, automated hacking tools with limited technical skills. | Low skill, limited resources. | Thrill, proving skill, seeking convenient targets. |
| **Hacktivists** | Use hacking techniques to achieve an **activist goal** or political cause. | Varies widely; often skilled and risk-tolerant. | Greater good, political change, social justice. |
| **Criminal Syndicates** | Organized crime groups focused on cybercrime. | Moderately to highly skilled, high resources. | Illegal **financial gain**. |
| **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)** | Nation-state actors or highly sophisticated groups using advanced techniques over a long period. | Highly skilled, significant resources/funding. | Political objectives, traditional espionage, stealing intellectual property (economic gain). |
| **Insiders** | Employees, contractors, or vendors with authorized access who misuse it. | Varies widely. | Financial gain, revenge, activism (whistleblowing). |

### Specialized Threats
* **Zero-Day Attacks:** Exploits a security **vulnerability unknown to product vendors**, meaning no patch is available. Often used by APTs.
* **Ransomware:** Malicious software that uses strong **encryption** to render a system's data inaccessible. Ransom is demanded for the decryption key. Newer attacks include the threat of **data disclosure** if the ransom is not paid.

## 4. Incident Response

Organizations must activate a formal **cybersecurity incident response plan** immediately following a data privacy breach.

### Definitions (NIST SP 800-61)
* **Event:** Any observable occurrence in a system or network (e.g., a user accessing a file).
* **Adverse Event:** Any event with negative consequences (e.g., malware infection).
* **Security Incident:** A violation or imminent threat of a violation of security policies (e.g., accidental loss of sensitive information, intrusion).

### Phases of Incident Response (NIST Model)
1.  **Preparation:** Building the foundation for the CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team), including policy, procedures, training, and purchasing **cyberinsurance**.
2.  **Detection and Analysis:** Identifying that an incident is occurring. Indicators include alerts (from IDS/antivirus), logs, publicly available information (new vulnerabilities), and reports from people.
3.  **Containment, Eradication, and Recovery:** Active measures to resolve the incident, including:
    * Selecting and implementing a containment strategy.
    * Gathering evidence for potential legal action.
    * Identifying attackers and systems.
    * Eradicating the incident and **recovering normal business operations**.
4.  **Post-Incident Activity:** Activities after resolution, including:
    * **Lessons-Learned Review:** A thorough review, ideally led by an **independent facilitator**, to improve procedures.
    * **Evidence Retention:** Identifying internal and external retention requirements (U.S. federal agencies must retain records for at least **three years**).

### Incident Response Plan Documentation
* **Policy:** The high-level cornerstone, approved by top management, assigning authority and roles. It should be relatively timeless (e.g., defining scope, roles, severity scheme).
* **Procedures and Playbooks:** *Procedures* provide detailed, tactical information. *Playbooks* describe step-by-step responses for **specific types of incidents** (e.g., "Web Server Defacement," "Breach of PII"). Playbooks are not a substitute for professional judgment.

### Data Breach Notification
* **U.S. Requirements:** The U.S. lacks a single federal law for broad breach notification, but **every state has its own data breach notification law**.
* **International:** Laws like the **GDPR** also include breach notification requirements. Organizations must untangle overlapping requirements and consult legal counsel.

## 5. Vendor Management

Managing risks posed by third-party vendors is critical, especially those handling personal information (like cloud vendors).

* **Master Service Agreement (MSA):** An **umbrella contract** for long-term work, including general security and privacy requirements.
* **Statement of Work (SOW):** Documents project-specific details, referencing the overarching MSA.
* **Service-Level Agreement (SLA):** Specifies the conditions of service (e.g., system availability, response time) and remedies for failure.
* **Business Associate Agreement (BAA):** Required by **HIPAA**; contractually obligates vendors (**Business Associates**) to comply with HIPAA's security, privacy, and breach rules.
* **PCI DSS:** Requires organizations to work only with vendors that are certified as compliant with **PCI DSS** requirements.
* **Vendor Incident Management:** Agreements must clearly spell out the vendor's obligation to **report known or suspected security incidents** to the customer.
