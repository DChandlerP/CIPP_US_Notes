## 1. Branches of U.S. Government

The U.S. federal government operates on a system of checks and balances with three coequal branches.

### Legislative Branch (Congress)
* **Role:** Creates new laws and revises existing ones.
* **Source of Power:** **Article I** of the U.S. Constitution (*Article I powers*).
* **Check on Executive:** Holds the **power of the purse** (controls spending) and the power of **impeachment** (requires a majority vote in the House and two-thirds conviction in the Senate).
* **Composition:**
    * **House of Representatives:** 435 voting members, based on population, elected to two-year terms.
    * **Senate:** 100 voting members (two per state), elected to six-year terms.

### Executive Branch (President, Departments, Agencies)
* **Role:** Carries out and enforces the laws created by the legislative branch.
* **Source of Power:** **Article II** of the U.S. Constitution (*Article II powers*).
* **Check on Legislative:** **Veto power** over bills passed by Congress (Congress can override with a two-thirds majority in both houses). The power to enforce (or decline to enforce) laws.

### Judicial Branch (Federal Court System)
* **Role:** Interprets the meaning of laws, resolves disputes, and determines constitutionality.
* **Source of Power:** **Article III** of the U.S. Constitution.
* **Check on Legislative & Executive:** **Judicial review**—the power to strike down laws or practices that conflict with the U.S. Constitution.
* **Court Structure (Lesser to Greater Superiority):**
    * **U.S. District Courts:** The trial courts of the federal system.
    * **U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeal:** Intermediate courts that accept cases on appeal from District Courts; decisions are binding only within their geographic circuit.
    * **U.S. Supreme Court:** Highest court; decisions are final and binding on all inferior courts. Determines which cases to accept through *certiorari*.

---

## 2. Sources of Law

Laws in the United States come from a variety of sources:

* **Constitutional Law:** The highest possible source of law; no other law may conflict with it. The **Supremacy Clause** (Article VI) establishes that the Constitution is the supreme law of the land.
    * The word *privacy* does not appear in the Constitution, but constitutional protections are established by the **Fourth Amendment** (protects against unreasonable searches and seizures) and Supreme Court precedent.
* **Legislation (Statutes):** Laws passed by Congress (federal) or state legislatures.
    * Federal laws are compiled in the **U.S. Code**.
* **Administrative Law:** Rules and regulations created by executive branch agencies to implement statutes.
    * Commonly documented in the **Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)**.
    * *Example:* The HIPAA Privacy Rule and Security Rule were created by HHS to implement the HIPAA statute.
* **Case Law:** Interpretations of law made by courts over time to resolve disputes.
    * **Stare Decisis:** (Latin for "let the decision stand") The principle that previous decisions on questions of law serve as **precedent** guiding future decisions.
* **Common Law:** A set of judicial precedents, originating from the English court system, that guides decisions even if not codified in legislation (e.g., torts like negligence).
* **Contract Law:** Legally binding agreements between parties to exchange things of value.
    * Requires: capacity, an offer, acceptance, **consideration** (exchange of value), and mutual intent to be bound.

---

## 3. Core Legal Concepts

### Jurisdiction
A court's authority to render legal judgments has two elements:

* **Personal Jurisdiction:** A court's authority over the **person** (individual or corporation) being sued. Established through:
    * Physical presence.
    * Place of residence or business.
    * **Consent** (e.g., a clause in a contract).
    * **Minimum contacts** (conducting business within a state).
* **Subject Matter Jurisdiction:** A court's authority to hear cases on a **particular area of the law** (e.g., federal courts over federal law).

### Legal Definitions
* **Person:** A legal entity that can sue, be sued, own property, and sign contracts. Includes **human beings** (citizens, residents) and **legal organizations** (corporations).
* **Preemption:** Law from a **higher authority** (e.g., federal) takes precedence over law from a lower authority (e.g., state). Established by the **Supremacy Clause**.
* **Private Right of Action (PRA):** The ability for **individuals and corporations** to bring cases to court for violations of a specific law.
    * **Contains PRA:** CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act).
    * **Lacks PRA:** FERPA, GLBA, HIPAA.

### Legal Liability
Liability is being responsible or answerable in law.

| Type | Description | Standard of Proof |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Criminal Liability** | Violating a criminal law (requires *mens rea* or "guilty mind"). | **Beyond a reasonable doubt** |
| **Civil Liability** | Failing to carry out a legal duty (e.g., breach of contract, torts). | **Preponderance of the evidence** (greater than 50% chance) |

### Torts and Negligence
* **Tort:** A civil wrong that involves harm to one party caused by the action or inaction of another, *not* involving a contract.
* **Negligence (A Tort):** Harm caused by a failure to act with reasonable care. Requires four elements:
    1.  **Duty of care:** An established responsibility.
    2.  **Breach of duty:** Violation of that responsibility.
    3.  **Damages:** The accuser suffered some form of harm (financial, physical, emotional).
    4.  **Causation:** The breach must be the result of the damages.
* **Four Invasion of Privacy Torts (Common Law):**
    1.  **Invasion of solitude:** Physical or electronic intrusion (e.g., accessing someone's email).
    2.  **Public disclosure of private facts:** Disclosure of truthful, non-newsworthy information that would offend a reasonable person.
    3.  **False light:** Disclosing information that causes a person to be **falsely perceived** by others.
    4.  **Appropriation:** Unauthorized use of someone’s name or likeness.

    # Regulatory Enforcement in U.S. Privacy

## Federal Regulatory Authorities

The **executive branch** enforces privacy laws through various agencies, often relying on the authority granted by different statutes.

### Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
* **Key Authority:** The FTC Act grants authority over **Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices (UDTPs)**, which is the primary basis for regulating privacy and cybersecurity.
* **Structure:** An independent agency led by five commissioners, with no more than three from the same political party.
* **Additional Laws:** Also enforces laws like the **Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)**.
* **Enforcement Process:**
    * Initiates **investigations** based on consumer complaints or other stimuli.
    * May issue a formal **complaint**.
    * Contested cases go before an **Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)**, with appeals possible to the FTC Commissioners and then the federal court system.
    * Most cases settle via an informal resolution or a formal, enforceable **consent decree**.

### Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices (UDTP)
A practice may be unfair, deceptive, or both.

| Standard | Criteria | Core Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unfair Practices** | 1. Injury must be **substantial** (financial harm or unwarranted health/safety risk). | Requires a finding that the injury is not outweighed by benefits and is not reasonably avoidable. |
| | 2. Injury must not be **outweighed by countervailing benefits** to consumers/competition. | Often applies when a company **fails to implement security controls** to enforce its own privacy policy (e.g., *Wyndham Worldwide*, *LabMD*). |
| | 3. Injury must not be **reasonably avoidable** by consumers. | |
| **Deceptive Practices** | 1. Practice must be **likely to mislead** the consumer (representation or omission). | Must be material—likely to affect the consumer’s conduct or decision regarding the product or service. |
| | 2. Examined from the perspective of a **consumer acting reasonably**. | Enforcement focuses on misrepresentations about data use, security, and message retention (e.g., *Facebook*, *Zoom*, *Snapchat*). |
| | 3. The representation, omission, or practice must be **material**. | |


# FTC Privacy Enforcement Case Examples (UDTP)

## Unfair Practices (Security Failures)
The FTC uses the **Unfair** standard when a company fails to implement reasonable security measures, leading to substantial consumer injury.

* **Wyndham Worldwide:** The hotel chain suffered multiple data breaches due to a failure to implement reasonable security (e.g., strong passwords, firewalls). The action was upheld, finding it **unfair** to promise security but fail to provide adequate safeguards.
* **LabMD:** The company exposed a file with patient information on a peer-to-peer network. The FTC found the lack of sufficient cybersecurity practices to be **unfair**.
* **DesignerWare:** A rent-to-own company secretly installed spyware on rented computers that captured keystrokes and images. This intrusive monitoring was deemed **unfair**.
* **LifeLock (Security):** The identity theft protection service failed to implement strong security controls for its own customer data, violating its advertising claims and a prior consent decree, resulting in a **$100 million fine**.

## Deceptive Practices (Misrepresentations)
The FTC uses the **Deceptive** standard when a company makes misleading statements or omissions about how it handles, protects, or uses personal data.

* **Facebook:** Charged with making deceptive claims about users' ability to control privacy, specifically allowing app developers access to user information even when users restricted access. This led to a large fine for violating a previous consent decree.
* **Zoom:** Misled consumers into believing its service used **end-to-end encryption** (only users see content), when it used less secure encryption that allowed Zoom to access the content.
* **Snapchat:** Informed users that messages and photos disappeared forever, while knowing that users could easily **preserve** them. This was a **material deception** about the service's core functionality.
* **GeoCities:** **Resold personal information** of customers after telling them in its privacy policy that it would **not** do so. This direct contradiction of its policy was deemed **deceptive**.
* **TRUSTe:** The privacy certification firm was found **deceptive** for failing to conduct required **annual recertifications** of its clients' privacy practices, violating the promise implied by its **Trust Mark** seal.

### Other Federal Agencies
* **Federal Communications Commission (FCC):** Regulates interstate and international communications, enforcing rules related to **Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI)** under the **Telecommunications Act of 1996**.
* **Department of Health and Human Services (HHS):** The lead agency for implementing and enforcing the **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)** Privacy and Security Rules, issuing substantial fines.
* **Department of Commerce (DOC):** Manages the U.S. portion of the **Privacy Shield** and its successor, the **Data Privacy Framework (DPF)**, which govern transatlantic data transfers.
* **Banking Regulators:**
    * **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)** is the lead agency for consumer financial protection.
    * Other involved agencies include the Federal Reserve, FDIC, NCUA, and OCC.
* **Department of Education (ED):** Enforces the **Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)**, which regulates the handling of student educational records.

## State Regulatory Authorities

State governments also have significant enforcement power.

* **Attorneys General (AG):** Most enforcement actions are brought by one or more state attorneys general under state privacy laws or **Unfair and Deceptive Acts and Practices (UDAP)** laws, which are similar to the FTC Act but vary by state.
* **California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA):** The first state-level agency specifically dedicated to privacy and data protection, established by the **California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)** to enforce its provisions.

## Self-Regulatory Programs

These programs allow industries to develop and enforce their own privacy and/or security standards, often to preempt government regulation.

* **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS):** A highly successful self-regulatory program focusing on security and data retention for the credit card processing industry. Merchants must comply via contractual agreements with banks.
    * It contains 12 high-level security requirements (e.g., firewalls, encryption, strong passwords).
* **Network Advertising Initiative (NAI):** A self-regulatory framework for digital advertising, publishing a code of conduct covering notice, opt-out, and data security. The NAI conducts compliance reviews and can refer noncompliant companies to the FTC.
* **Trust Marks:** Symbols (e.g., the **TRUSTe** seal) displayed on a company’s website to show that an independent third party has certified the company meets specific privacy standards.
* **Safe Harbors:** Agreements like the **Privacy Shield** (and its successor, the DPF) that offer firms exemption from prosecution under certain laws if they demonstrate compliance with specified regulatory requirements, particularly for international data transfers.
* 
# Information Management

## 1. Data Governance

**Data governance** programs identify, track, and manage sensitive information to ensure consistent data handling practices across an organization.

### Building a Data Inventory
Developing an inventory is the first step in managing sensitive data. Organizations should catalog the types and locations of sensitive information they maintain:

* **Personally Identifiable Information (PII):** Broadly refers to any information that uniquely identifies an individual.
* **Protected Health Information (PHI):** Medical records subject to **HIPAA**.
* **Financial Information:** Personal financial records maintained by the organization.
* **Government Information:** Data subject to specific rules and classification requirements.

### Data Classification
**Data classification** organizes data into categories based on sensitivity and the potential impact of unauthorized disclosure. This guides the selection of security controls.

* **Government Terminology:** Uses categories like *Top Secret*, *Secret*, *Confidential*, and *Unclassified*.
* **Business Terminology:** Often uses terms like *Highly Sensitive*, *Sensitive*, *Internal*, and *Public*.
* **NIST Guidance:** The **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)** publishes guides like **SP 800-53** to specify controls for low, moderate, and high-impact information.

### Data Flow Mapping
**Data flow mapping** tracks how personal information is **received, handled, shared, and disposed of** throughout the organization.

* This process produces **data flow diagrams** that vary in detail (technical vs. business process).
* Diagrams help identify potential privacy and regulatory concerns, especially with **third-party data sharing**.

### Data Lifecycle Management
Data protection must be maintained from collection to disposal.

* **Data Minimization:** Collecting the **smallest possible amount** of information necessary to meet business requirements.
* **Purpose Limitation:** Information should only be used for the **purpose for which it was originally collected** and consented to.
* **Data and Records Retention:** Data should be kept only for as long as necessary.
* **Secure Disposal:** Data must be securely destroyed so a determined adversary cannot reconstruct it.
    * **Paper Records:** Shredding (cross-cut), incineration, or pulping.
    * **Electronic Media:** Electronic erasure, degaussing (magnetic fields), or physical destruction.
* **FACTA Disposal Rule:** Requires covered organizations to take **“reasonable measures to protect against unauthorized access or use of the information in connection with its disposal”** of consumer reports (e.g., shredding, using certified destruction vendors).

## 2. Workforce Training

Workforce training ensures users understand their obligations and the risks involved with handling personal information.

* **Regular Training:** Should take place on an ongoing basis, often using **computer-based training (CBT)**.
* **Role-Based Training:** Training should be customized to an individual's job responsibilities (e.g., system administrators need highly technical training; customer service needs more focus on social engineering).
* **Content:** Must include regulatory requirements and practical steps for protecting data.

## 3. Cybersecurity Threats

Threat actors are differentiated by their sophistication, resources, motivation, and whether they are **internal** or **external**.

| Threat Actor | Description | Skill/Resources | Motivation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Script Kiddies** | Users of pre-built, automated hacking tools with limited technical skills. | Low skill, limited resources. | Thrill, proving skill, seeking convenient targets. |
| **Hacktivists** | Use hacking techniques to achieve an **activist goal** or political cause. | Varies widely; often skilled and risk-tolerant. | Greater good, political change, social justice. |
| **Criminal Syndicates** | Organized crime groups focused on cybercrime. | Moderately to highly skilled, high resources. | Illegal **financial gain**. |
| **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)** | Nation-state actors or highly sophisticated groups using advanced techniques over a long period. | Highly skilled, significant resources/funding. | Political objectives, traditional espionage, stealing intellectual property (economic gain). |
| **Insiders** | Employees, contractors, or vendors with authorized access who misuse it. | Varies widely. | Financial gain, revenge, activism (whistleblowing). |

### Specialized Threats
* **Zero-Day Attacks:** Exploits a security **vulnerability unknown to product vendors**, meaning no patch is available. Often used by APTs.
* **Ransomware:** Malicious software that uses strong **encryption** to render a system's data inaccessible. Ransom is demanded for the decryption key. Newer attacks include the threat of **data disclosure** if the ransom is not paid.

## 4. Incident Response

Organizations must activate a formal **cybersecurity incident response plan** immediately following a data privacy breach.

### Definitions (NIST SP 800-61)
* **Event:** Any observable occurrence in a system or network (e.g., a user accessing a file).
* **Adverse Event:** Any event with negative consequences (e.g., malware infection).
* **Security Incident:** A violation or imminent threat of a violation of security policies (e.g., accidental loss of sensitive information, intrusion).

### Phases of Incident Response (NIST Model)
1.  **Preparation:** Building the foundation for the CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team), including policy, procedures, training, and purchasing **cyberinsurance**.
2.  **Detection and Analysis:** Identifying that an incident is occurring. Indicators include alerts (from IDS/antivirus), logs, publicly available information (new vulnerabilities), and reports from people.
3.  **Containment, Eradication, and Recovery:** Active measures to resolve the incident, including:
    * Selecting and implementing a containment strategy.
    * Gathering evidence for potential legal action.
    * Identifying attackers and systems.
    * Eradicating the incident and **recovering normal business operations**.
4.  **Post-Incident Activity:** Activities after resolution, including:
    * **Lessons-Learned Review:** A thorough review, ideally led by an **independent facilitator**, to improve procedures.
    * **Evidence Retention:** Identifying internal and external retention requirements (U.S. federal agencies must retain records for at least **three years**).

### Incident Response Plan Documentation
* **Policy:** The high-level cornerstone, approved by top management, assigning authority and roles. It should be relatively timeless (e.g., defining scope, roles, severity scheme).
* **Procedures and Playbooks:** *Procedures* provide detailed, tactical information. *Playbooks* describe step-by-step responses for **specific types of incidents** (e.g., "Web Server Defacement," "Breach of PII"). Playbooks are not a substitute for professional judgment.

### Data Breach Notification
* **U.S. Requirements:** The U.S. lacks a single federal law for broad breach notification, but **every state has its own data breach notification law**.
* **International:** Laws like the **GDPR** also include breach notification requirements. Organizations must untangle overlapping requirements and consult legal counsel.

## 5. Vendor Management

Managing risks posed by third-party vendors is critical, especially those handling personal information (like cloud vendors).

* **Master Service Agreement (MSA):** An **umbrella contract** for long-term work, including general security and privacy requirements.
* **Statement of Work (SOW):** Documents project-specific details, referencing the overarching MSA.
* **Service-Level Agreement (SLA):** Specifies the conditions of service (e.g., system availability, response time) and remedies for failure.
* **Business Associate Agreement (BAA):** Required by **HIPAA**; contractually obligates vendors (**Business Associates**) to comply with HIPAA's security, privacy, and breach rules.
* **PCI DSS:** Requires organizations to work only with vendors that are certified as compliant with **PCI DSS** requirements.
* **Vendor Incident Management:** Agreements must clearly spell out the vendor's obligation to **report known or suspected security incidents** to the customer.

## FTC Privacy Protection
The **Federal Trade Commission (FTC)** is the lead agency for broad consumer protection in the private sector, enforcing the **FTC Act** (Section 5) against **unfair and deceptive trade practices**.

* **FTC’s Role:** Regulates private sector privacy through enforcement actions based on published privacy policies versus actual business conduct, conducts studies, and advises lawmakers. The US lacks a single comprehensive federal privacy law.
* **Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA):** Provides special protection for children under 13.
    * **Scope:** Applies to online services (websites, apps, etc.) that are intended for, or knowingly collect data from, children under 13.
    * **Requirements:** Requires online operators to post a complete **Privacy Policy**, provide **Parental Notification**, obtain verifiable **Parental Consent** before collection, grant parents the right to review/delete data, and implement **Information Security** programs.
* **Future of Enforcement:** Addresses challenges from new technologies like **Big Data**, **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and the **Internet of Things (IoT)**, which enable new business models like data brokers and cross-border data flows.

***

## Medical Privacy
Federal laws provide special protections for personal medical information.

* **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA):** Sets standards for the privacy and security of **Protected Health Information (PHI)** and **electronic PHI (ePHI)**.
    * **Scope:** Applies to **Covered Entities** (health plans, clearinghouses, providers) and their **Business Associates** (third parties with access to PHI, bound by **Business Associate Agreements** or BAAs).
    * **Privacy Rule:** Governs the **use and disclosure** of PHI, requiring the **minimum necessary** amount of PHI be shared. Grants **Individual Rights** to patients (e.g., to access, correct, and request restrictions on their data).
    * **Security Rule:** Applies only to ePHI, requiring covered entities to conduct a regular **risk analysis** and implement safeguards for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
* **Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act (2009):** Promoted Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and strengthened HIPAA.
    * **Key Change:** Extended HIPAA's direct liability to **Business Associates** and introduced the **Breach Notification Rule** (requiring notice to victims and HHS within **60 days** for significant breaches).
* **21st Century Cures Act (2016):** Encourages standardized EHRs, penalizes **information blocking** (preventing appropriate sharing of ePHI), and facilitates sharing of mental health/substance abuse information with family/caregivers.
* **Confidentiality of Substance Use Disorder Patient Records Rule (42 CFR Part 2):** Provides heightened confidentiality for substance use disorder treatment records, generally requiring patient consent for disclosure.

***

## Financial Privacy
Regulations govern the financial sector, including credit, banking, and insurance.

* **Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) (1970):** Regulates **Consumer Reporting Agencies (CRAs)**.
    * **Purpose:** Ensures the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of **consumer reports** used in decisions about credit, insurance, or employment.
    * **Rights:** Gives consumers the right to **access their report/score**, be informed of unfavorable decisions, and **dispute inaccurate information**. Sharing is limited to **permissible purposes**.
* **Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACTA) (2003):** Updated FCRA to combat identity theft.
    * **Provisions:** Guaranteed the right to **free annual credit reports** and allowed consumers to place **fraud alerts** on their reports.
* **Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act (GLBA) (1999):** Regulates **financial institutions**.
    * **Privacy Rule:** Requires providing a **Privacy Notice** to **customers** (ongoing relationship) initially and annually. Allows for sharing of customer information, but the notice must inform customers of the institution's policies.
    * **Safeguards Rule:** Requires a written **information security program** to protect customer information against anticipated threats.
* **Red Flags Rule:** Mandates that financial institutions and creditors develop a written plan to proactively monitor consumer data for signs (**red flags**) of identity theft.
* **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB):** Created by the Dodd–Frank Act (2008). Enforces against **Unfair, Deceptive, or Abusive Acts and Practices (UDAAPs)** in the financial sector.

***

## Educational Privacy
The education sector is regulated to protect student academic records.

* **Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (1974):** Protects the privacy of **student educational records**.
    * **Scope:** Applies to almost all educational institutions receiving **federal funding** from the U.S. Department of Education.
    * **Requirements:** Prohibits schools from sharing educational records without the consent of the student (over 18 or in higher education) or parent/guardian (for minors), except for specific exceptions (e.g., to "school officials" with a **legitimate educational interest**). Grants the right to inspect and seek correction of records.

***

## Telecommunications and Marketing Privacy
Laws in this sector regulate how businesses can use personal data for marketing.

* **Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) (1991) & Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR):** Regulate unsolicited telemarketing calls and text messages.
    * **Key Provision:** Established the **National Do-Not-Call (DNC) Registry**. Telemarketers must update their DNC list every 31 days and cannot call numbers on it, with exceptions for things like political calls, charities, and the **Established Business Relationship (EBR)** exemption.
* **Controlling the Assault of Non-solicited Pornography and Marketing (CAN-SPAM) Act (2003):** Regulates all **commercial electronic messages** (including email and social media messages).
    * **Requirements:** Senders must be honest (accurate header, physical address), clearly identify the message as an advertisement, and provide a simple, free **opt-out** mechanism, honoring requests within 10 business days.
* **Video Privacy Protection Act (VPPA) (1988):** Protects a consumer’s video rental/purchase history. Disclosure requires written consent (including electronic consent). Its privacy protections are now being applied to **streaming media services**.
* **Driver’s Privacy Protection Act (DPPA) (1994):** Prevents states from indiscriminately releasing personal information from **DMV driver’s licensing databases** (e.g., name, address, photo), allowing sharing only for specific permissible purposes.
* **Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI):** Rules under the **Telecommunications Act** governing metadata about subscriber phone calls. Carriers must implement safeguards and obtain consent before sharing CPNI outside of limited, allowed uses.

# Government and Court Access to Private Sector Information Notes

## 🏛️ Constitutional Foundation
* **Fourth Amendment:** Protects U.S. citizens from **"unreasonable searches and seizures"** by federal agencies without a legal **warrant**. It covers "persons, houses, papers, and effects."
* ***Katz v. United States* (1967):** Established that the Fourth Amendment protects an individual's "reasonable expectation of privacy," even in public places. This is crucial for electronic communications.
* ***Third-Party Doctrine:*** Established by ***United States v. Miller* (1976)**. Once a person voluntarily turns information over to a third party (e.g., banks, service providers) for transactions, that information is no longer considered the individual's property and is generally **not protected** by the Fourth Amendment.

## 🚔 Law Enforcement and Privacy

### Access to Financial Data

| Legislation | Purpose | Key Requirements | Privacy Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Right to Financial Privacy Act (RFPA) of 1978** | Regulates how federal authorities access customer records from financial institutions (FIs) following the *Miller* ruling. | Requires the government to notify the customer and provide a chance to **object** within 10 days (14 days if mailed). Disclosure must be authorized by: **Customer Authorization**, **Administrative/Judicial Subpoena**, **Search Warrant** (90-day notification delay), or **Formal Written Request**. | Provides some due process rights, but not Fourth Amendment protection. |
| **Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) of 1970** (a.k.a. Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act) | Established to combat **money laundering** and terrorist financing by creating a financial paper trail. | FIs must have an **Anti-Money Laundering (AML) program** and a **Customer Identification Program (CIP)**. Requires FIs to file: **Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs)** (transactions over \$10,000/day) and **Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs)**. | **Reduces privacy**; FIs are **prohibited from notifying customers** when filing an SAR (making SARs an exception to the RFPA). |

### Access to Communications

* **Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) of 1986:** Primary legislation regulating government eavesdropping.

| ECPA Title | Common Name | Scope | Privacy Standard |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Title I** | **Wiretap Act** | Prohibits spying on **real-time** oral, wire, or electronic communication without **consent** (one-party consent federally) or a warrant. | High protection, requiring a warrant for content. |
| **Title II** | **Stored Communications Act (SCA)** | Extends Fourth Amendment-like protection to **digital communications stored** on third-party servers (e.g., email). Requires a **search warrant** for government access. | Lower protection than real-time, due to third-party doctrine, but enhanced by the SCA. |
| **Title III** | **Pen Registers/Trap-and-Trace** | Regulates technologies that track communications **metadata** (e.g., phone numbers, date/time) but **not content**. | Lower protection; generally requires only a court order. |

* **CLOUD Act (2018):** Amends the SCA to compel U.S.-based companies to provide data stored on servers, regardless of the data’s **physical, overseas location**.
* **Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA):** Requires telecommunications carriers and manufacturers to design their devices and services to **enable authorized government surveillance** capabilities (wiretapping) to be **"baked-in"** features.
    * **Limitation:** CALEA **does not compel** companies to assist the government with **decrypting** encrypted communications.

---

## 🔒 National Security and Privacy

* In national security, the stakes are higher, often leading lawmakers to grant the government **more power** than for regular law enforcement.

### Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) of 1978

* **Purpose:** Provides a legal framework for the government to track **foreign targets** and agents spying on the U.S. while setting due process and oversight.
* **FISC:** Established the **Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court**, a secret court that issues warrants for surveillance under FISA.
* **Targets:** Surveillance is easier if the target is **not a "United States person"** (U.S. citizens, legal aliens, U.S. corporations, etc.).
* **Minimization Principle:** Requires the U.S. Attorney General to implement procedures to ensure that intelligence gathered and retained **pertains only to the intended investigation** and avoids collecting incidental information on U.S. persons.

| Key Amendments/Related Acts | Impact on Surveillance Power |
| :--- | :--- |
| **USA-PATRIOT Act (2001)** | **Expanded power**, lowering FISA's surveillance threshold from "primary purpose" to **"significant purpose."** |
| **FISA Amendments Act Section 702 (2008)** | Allows the government to obtain **broad certifications** (not warrants) from FISC to conduct surveillance on **non-U.S. persons located abroad**. This has led to the **mass collection** of communications data. |
| **Section 206: Roving Wiretaps** (Patriot Act) | Authorized surveillance of **any device** associated with an individual, rather than specific devices/numbers. (Expired March 2020) |
| **Section 215: Business Records Provision** (Patriot Act) | Allowed the government to order businesses to share records of any **"tangible things"** relevant to foreign intelligence, bypassing other laws (used for bulk phone record collection). (Expired March 2020) |
| **USA FREEDOM Act (2015)** | **Curtailed power** by requiring requests to list **"selection terms"** (specific criteria like phone numbers) to end the bulk data collection programs revealed by Edward Snowden. Also reformed **National Security Letters (NSLs)**. |

* **National Security Letters (NSLs):** A type of **administrative subpoena** used to compel the production of business records (stored email, phone data). Often includes a **gag order** prohibiting the recipient from disclosing the request.

### Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) of 2015

* **Purpose:** Encourages **voluntary sharing** of **cyber-threat indicators** between private companies and the federal government by **removing legal barriers**.
* **Safe Harbor:** Provides private companies protection from certain liabilities (like those under the ECPA or antitrust laws) when sharing information **in accordance with CISA's protocols**.
* **Privacy:** Companies are required to **remove PII** before sharing unless that information is directly related to the cyber threat itself.

* ***Zurcher v. Stanford Daily* (1978):** Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution **does not protect journalists** from duly authorized search warrants.
* **Privacy Protection Act (PPA) of 1980:** Prohibits law enforcement from using a **search warrant** to seize journalistic **"work product materials"** and **"documentary materials."**
    * To compel disclosure, law enforcement must generally use a **subpoena duces tecum**, which provides the journalist with **advance notice** and the opportunity to challenge the order in court.
    * PPA provides a **private right of action** against agencies that violate the law.

### Electronic Discovery (eDiscovery)

* The process of identifying, collecting, and producing electronic records for legal proceedings.
* **Key Stages (often managed by legal counsel):**
    1.  **Identification:** Determining which records are subject to discovery, often assisted by IT staff.
    2.  **Preservation:** Placing relevant records under a **legal hold** to prevent alteration or destruction.
    3.  **Collection:** Gathering the preserved records and securely transferring them to legal counsel.
    4.  **Processing:** Converting data to reviewable formats.
    5.  **Review:** Attorneys examine the records to **redact or remove** information that is irrelevant, protected by privilege, or protected by statute.
    6.  **Production and Presentation:** Sharing the finalized information with the opposing parties or court.

## I. Introduction to Workplace Privacy
Workplace privacy in the U.S. is not governed by a single comprehensive law but by a "patchwork" of federal and state statutes, tort law, and contracts. The primary drivers of federal workplace privacy legislation are **antidiscrimination** and **labor rights**, rather than privacy for privacy's sake.

### A. Key Regulatory Agencies
* **Federal Trade Commission (FTC):** Regulates background screening via the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).
* **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB):** Shares FCRA enforcement with the FTC; targets background check companies for inaccuracies.
* **Department of Labor (DOL):** Enforces fair labor standards and laws like FMLA, OSHA, and EPPA.
* **Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC):** Enforces antidiscrimination laws (ADA, ADEA, Title VII, GINA).
* **National Labor Relations Board (NLRB):** Protects workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively; regulates employer surveillance that might intimidate union activities.
* **Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA):** Ensures workplace safety; protects confidentiality of employee complaints and medical records related to workplace safety.
* **Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC):** Requires public companies to disclose human capital metrics relevant to investors.

## II. U.S. Antidiscrimination Laws
Federal laws restrict the collection and use of personal data to prevent bias.

* **Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII):** Prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, or sex (including pregnancy/childbirth).
* **Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA):**
    * Prohibits discrimination based on disability if the person is qualified and can perform essential functions with **reasonable accommodation**.
    * **Medical Exams:** Pre-employment medical exams are banned before a conditional job offer. Medical info must be kept in separate, confidential files.
    * **Undue Hardship:** Employers are not required to provide accommodations that cause significant difficulty/expense.
* **Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA):**
    * Prohibits using genetic info (including family medical history) for hiring, firing, or promotion.
    * Generally prohibits collecting genetic info, with narrow exceptions (e.g., accidental acquisition, FMLA requests, wellness programs).

## III. Privacy Before Employment (Screening)
### A. Automated Employment Decision Tools
* Use of AI/algorithms in hiring creates risks of unintentional bias (e.g., facial analysis penalizing certain groups).
* **Regulation:** Some jurisdictions (e.g., NYC) require bias audits and notices to candidates before using AI in hiring.

### B. Background Screening & The FCRA
Background checks by third parties are usually considered **Consumer Reports** under the FCRA.
* **Employer Obligations:**
    1.  Provide written notice to the applicant.
    2.  Obtain written authorization.
    3.  Certify compliance to the background check provider (CRA).
    4.  **Investigative Consumer Reports:** If interviewing neighbors/associates about character, specific notice of the "investigative" nature is required.
* **Adverse Action:** If not hiring based on the report, employers must follow specific pre-adverse and adverse action notice procedures.

### C. Other Screening Methods
* **Polygraphs:** The **Employee Polygraph Protection Act (EPPA)** bans most private employers from using lie detectors for pre-employment screening.
    * *Exceptions:* Government, security firms, pharmaceutical distributors, or specific theft investigations.
* **Drug/Alcohol Testing:** Regulated by a mix of state laws and federal requirements (e.g., DOT). The **Drug-Free Workplace Act** encourages, but doesn't always mandate, testing.
* **Social Media:** Employers often check profiles but risk seeing protected class info (race, religion). Best practice is using a third party to redact protected info.

## IV. Privacy During Employment (Monitoring)
Employees generally have **no expectation of privacy** using company equipment.

### A. Monitoring Technologies
* **Computer/Phone Usage:** Employers own the equipment and can monitor use.
* **Location Tracking:** GPS monitoring of company vehicles/phones is generally permitted, though some states require notice.
* **Biometrics:** Collecting fingerprints/face scans for timekeeping is common. States like IL, TX, and WA have specific laws requiring notice/consent/retention policies.
* **Wellness Programs:** Employers can offer incentives for health programs. Collection of health data must be voluntary and not penalized if opted out (EEOC rules).

### B. Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA)
Regulates interception of wire, oral, and electronic communications.
* **The "Business Purpose" Exception:** Employers can monitor calls/emails if there is a legitimate business reason.
    * *Limitation:* Monitoring must stop if the communication is determined to be personal.
* **Consent:** Monitoring is legal if one party consents (federal law). Some states require all-party consent.
* **Stored Communications Act (SCA):** accessing stored emails (on company servers) is generally easier than intercepting real-time calls, as company ownership usually negates privacy expectations.

### C. Investigation of Misconduct
* **Fairness:** Investigations must be evenhanded to avoid discrimination claims.
* **FACTA Amendment:** The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act amended the FCRA so that **misconduct investigation reports** by third parties are **not** treated as standard consumer reports.
    * *Result:* Employers do *not* need to get prior consent to investigate an employee for suspected misconduct, nor do they need to provide the full report (only a summary if adverse action is taken).

## V. Privacy After Employment
### A. Termination Procedures
* **Transition Management:** Securely ending the relationship.
* **Access Control:** Immediate revocation of physical (keys, badges) and digital (email, network) access.
* **Property Return:** Retrieving laptops and ensuring no company data remains on personal devices.

### B. Records Retention
* Employers must follow retention schedules for personnel files (performance reviews, disciplinary records, medical info) to comply with laws and prepare for potential litigation (eDiscovery).

### C. References
* No federal requirement to provide references.
* **Service Letter Acts:** Some states require employers to provide basic employment verification (dates, title).
* **Defamation Risk:** Many employers limit references to basic facts (dates/title) to avoid lawsuits from former employees regarding negative comments.
