## 1. Branches of U.S. Government

The U.S. federal government operates on a system of checks and balances with three coequal branches.

### Legislative Branch (Congress)
* **Role:** Creates new laws and revises existing ones.
* **Source of Power:** **Article I** of the U.S. Constitution (*Article I powers*).
* **Check on Executive:** Holds the **power of the purse** (controls spending) and the power of **impeachment** (requires a majority vote in the House and two-thirds conviction in the Senate).
* **Composition:**
    * **House of Representatives:** 435 voting members, based on population, elected to two-year terms.
    * **Senate:** 100 voting members (two per state), elected to six-year terms.

### Executive Branch (President, Departments, Agencies)
* **Role:** Carries out and enforces the laws created by the legislative branch.
* **Source of Power:** **Article II** of the U.S. Constitution (*Article II powers*).
* **Check on Legislative:** **Veto power** over bills passed by Congress (Congress can override with a two-thirds majority in both houses). The power to enforce (or decline to enforce) laws.

### Judicial Branch (Federal Court System)
* **Role:** Interprets the meaning of laws, resolves disputes, and determines constitutionality.
* **Source of Power:** **Article III** of the U.S. Constitution.
* **Check on Legislative & Executive:** **Judicial review**—the power to strike down laws or practices that conflict with the U.S. Constitution.
* **Court Structure (Lesser to Greater Superiority):**
    * **U.S. District Courts:** The trial courts of the federal system.
    * **U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeal:** Intermediate courts that accept cases on appeal from District Courts; decisions are binding only within their geographic circuit.
    * **U.S. Supreme Court:** Highest court; decisions are final and binding on all inferior courts. Determines which cases to accept through *certiorari*.

## 2. Sources of Law

Laws in the United States come from a variety of sources:

* **Constitutional Law:** The highest possible source of law; no other law may conflict with it. The **Supremacy Clause** (Article VI) establishes that the Constitution is the supreme law of the land.
    * The word *privacy* does not appear in the Constitution, but constitutional protections are established by the **Fourth Amendment** (protects against unreasonable searches and seizures) and Supreme Court precedent.
* **Legislation (Statutes):** Laws passed by Congress (federal) or state legislatures.
    * Federal laws are compiled in the **U.S. Code**.
* **Administrative Law:** Rules and regulations created by executive branch agencies to implement statutes.
    * Commonly documented in the **Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)**.
    * *Example:* The HIPAA Privacy Rule and Security Rule were created by HHS to implement the HIPAA statute.
* **Case Law:** Interpretations of law made by courts over time to resolve disputes.
    * **Stare Decisis:** (Latin for "let the decision stand") The principle that previous decisions on questions of law serve as **precedent** guiding future decisions.
* **Common Law:** A set of judicial precedents, originating from the English court system, that guides decisions even if not codified in legislation (e.g., torts like negligence).
* **Contract Law:** Legally binding agreements between parties to exchange things of value.
    * Requires: capacity, an offer, acceptance, **consideration** (exchange of value), and mutual intent to be bound.

## 3. Core Legal Concepts

### Jurisdiction
A court's authority to render legal judgments has two elements:

* **Personal Jurisdiction:** A court's authority over the **person** (individual or corporation) being sued. Established through:
    * Physical presence.
    * Place of residence or business.
    * **Consent** (e.g., a clause in a contract).
    * **Minimum contacts** (conducting business within a state).
* **Subject Matter Jurisdiction:** A court's authority to hear cases on a **particular area of the law** (e.g., federal courts over federal law).

### Legal Definitions
* **Person:** A legal entity that can sue, be sued, own property, and sign contracts. Includes **human beings** (citizens, residents) and **legal organizations** (corporations).
* **Preemption:** Law from a **higher authority** (e.g., federal) takes precedence over law from a lower authority (e.g., state). Established by the **Supremacy Clause**.
* **Private Right of Action (PRA):** The ability for **individuals and corporations** to bring cases to court for violations of a specific law.
    * **Contains PRA:** CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act).
    * **Lacks PRA:** FERPA, GLBA, HIPAA.

### Legal Liability
Liability is being responsible or answerable in law.

| Type | Description | Standard of Proof |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Criminal Liability** | Violating a criminal law (requires *mens rea* or "guilty mind"). | **Beyond a reasonable doubt** |
| **Civil Liability** | Failing to carry out a legal duty (e.g., breach of contract, torts). | **Preponderance of the evidence** (greater than 50% chance) |

### Torts and Negligence
* **Tort:** A civil wrong that involves harm to one party caused by the action or inaction of another, *not* involving a contract.
* **Negligence (A Tort):** Harm caused by a failure to act with reasonable care. Requires four elements:
    1.  **Duty of care:** An established responsibility.
    2.  **Breach of duty:** Violation of that responsibility.
    3.  **Damages:** The accuser suffered some form of harm (financial, physical, emotional).
    4.  **Causation:** The breach must be the result of the damages.
* **Four Invasion of Privacy Torts (Common Law):**
    1.  **Invasion of solitude:** Physical or electronic intrusion (e.g., accessing someone's email).
    2.  **Public disclosure of private facts:** Disclosure of truthful, non-newsworthy information that would offend a reasonable person.
    3.  **False light:** Disclosing information that causes a person to be **falsely perceived** by others.
    4.  **Appropriation:** Unauthorized use of someone’s name or likeness.
